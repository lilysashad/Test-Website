	<H2 style="color:blue;">As of December 24, 2020,</H2>

	<p style="font-size:110%;">I've been struggling to find good, new music. However, it's honestly not difficult to find decent content, especially <br>since I listen to a bunch of playlists on YouTube. They're usually titled along the lines of "K-Indie/Hip-hop/R&B". <br>There could be 13 songs in the entire video, but I would always find a gem in my suggested videos.</p>

	<p style="font-size:110%;">One gem I was able to find is <strong>Endless Summer</strong> by <em>CIKI</em>.</p>

	<BR/>

	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEdpe83Nik4">Check it out here!<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/kindie/images/0/07/CIKI_Syndrome_album_cover.png/revision/latest?cb=20190908061525"/></a>

	<p style="color:purple; font-size:110%;">Yesterday, I was jamming out to this song and also low-key set a video of myself jamming to it as my profile video <br>on social media. <em>Endless Summer</em> is such a feel-good song with a beautiful instrumental. The vocals are unique, <br>and I will simple say: <em>CIKI's </em>vocals are actually my favorite in the K-Indie genre.</p>

<p><strong>Jeebanoff</strong> is ranked first because I'd heard of him first with his song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnTd-X4hRtU">Truth</a>. It basically became my anthem for quarantine. <br>Jeebanoff also released an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS5LxElJLRQ">album</a> recently, titled <em>Talking Book</em>, and I love nearly every track on it. It's incredibly calming and <br>I could picture the entire album being featured in some drama.</p>

<p><strong>CIKI</strong> is ranked second because I've only recently found his works, like <em>Endless Summer</em> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFVarolUqJU">Syndrome</a>. The instrumentals <br>are pretty and his vocals really suit this genre- it kinda reminds me of singing in italics, but less cringey. I also especially like his <br>feature on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JnQ2MGL-NE">Instant Date</a> by <em>Kumira</em>. His songs are perfect for chill vlogs.

<p><strong>Seo Actor</strong> is last, but he's definitely not the worst. I like the melancholic tone he sets in his works- it contrasts with CIKI. <br>However, in my opinion, his content can be hit or miss. Some songs I like of Seo Actor are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMEOTo-hDyk">August</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfTC9iAUrpk">I'll Be There</a>. Although <br>Seo Actor is ranked last, I still look forward to his works- I hope he releases an album like CIKI has!</p>
