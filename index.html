	<H2>As of December 24, 2020,</H2>

	<p>I've been struggling to find good, new music. However, it's honestly not difficult to find decent content, especially <br>since I listen to a bunch of playlists on YouTube. They're usually titled along the lines of "K-Indie/Hip-hop/R&B". <br>There could be 13 songs in the entire video, but I would always find a gem in my suggested videos.</p>
    
    	<p id="context">Yesterday, I was jamming out to this new song and also low-key set a video of myself jamming to it as my profile video <br>on social media. <em>Endless Summer</em> is such a feel-good song with a beautiful instrumental. The vocals are unique, <br>and I will simple say: <em>CIKI's </em>vocals are actually my favorite in the K-Indie genre.</p>

        <p id="lyrics"><em><strong>"I want you to come before bed
        <br>I was scared so I actually wanted to quit<br>
        What we wrote on the bridge above the Han River<br>
        Even if it's crazy, you have to live to the end"<br>

<!-- This is a ranked K-Indie Artists table -->

            <img id="jeeb" src="jeebanoff.jpg" alt="Jeebanoff"/>
    
            <p><strong>Jeebanoff</strong> is ranked first because I'd heard of him first with his song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnTd-X4hRtU" target="_blank">Truth</a>. It basically<br>became my anthem for quarantine. Jeebanoff also released an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS5LxElJLRQ" target="_blank">album</a> recently, titled<br><em>Talking Book</em>, and I love nearly every track on it. It's incredibly calming and I could<br>picture the entire album being featured in some drama.</p>

            <img id="ciki" src="ciki_cover.png" alt="Ciki"/>
    
            <p><strong>CIKI</strong> is ranked second because I've only recently found his works, like <em>Endless Summer</em> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFVarolUqJU" target="_blank">Syndrome</a>. The instrumentals are pretty and his vocals really suit this genre- it kinda reminds me of singing in italics, but less cringey. I also especially like his feature on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JnQ2MGL-NE" target="_blank">Instant Date</a> by <em>Kumira</em>. His songs are perfect for chill vlogs.

            <img id="seo_actor" src="seo_actor.jpg" alt="Seo Actor"/>
    
            <p><strong>Seo Actor</strong> is last, but he's definitely not the worst. I like the melancholic tone he sets in his works- it contrasts with CIKI. However, in my opinion, his content can be hit or miss. Some songs I like of Seo Actor are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMEOTo-hDyk" target="_blank">August</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfTC9iAUrpk" target="_blank">I'll Be There</a>. Although Seo Actor is ranked last, I still look forward to his works- I hope he releases an album like CIKI has!</p>
