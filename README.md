**K-Indie ft. Lily** is a practice website I made with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for my Coursera: Introduction to Web Development course.

Submitted by: **Lily Deng**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## Week 2

* [x] a head section
* [x] a body section
* [x] text in the body section
* [x] use of paragraph tag(s) and heading tag(s)
* [x] at least one image embedded from an external web location (like Google Images) (to be removed late

## Week 3

* [x] Create an HTML page with a header and body section
* [x] Create a JavaScript program that displays the alert "Nice to Meet You!" in your native language when the page is run in a browser.
* [x] The script should use 1 function, created in the header of the page and that function should be called correctly in the body of the HTML page.

## Week 4

* [x] Create an HTML page with a header and body section that includes some text, at least one image, and at least one table (with as many rows and columns as you want)
* [x] Create an external CSS file that is properly linked to the webpage you've designed, that includes at least 5 different classes or IDs that modify elements of the linked webpage.
* [x] At least one of the classes or IDs must control layout using layers (Div tag), and the rest should modify properties such as fonts, colors, background-color, etc. If you want an extra challenge, research how to control some other CSS properties that you think would be useful when designing webpages and use it.

 ## Notes

Will revisit and update this page for the remainder of the course
